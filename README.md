Purple Team client project - Stakeholder Input Synthesis Tool

## Set-up Local Database (on a Mac)
1) Install the [Postgres App](https://postgresapp.com/) and [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-macos/)

2) Open the Postgres app and create a new server. Make sure to use port 5432. The name doesn't really matter. Make sure the directory you choose is empty, and then initialize the server.

## Run Instructions
```
npm install

npm start
```

Direct your browser to localhost:3000 to use the app.
